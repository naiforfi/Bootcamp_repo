During the data analysis we found that thers is a relation when ploting the features: `temperature` and pressure (`barometer`) which it seems whether was rain occured or not. However, we belive that other weather factor can support the relationship which may help us to predict more precisely.

Logstic regression is been used with minimal features resulted as accuracy of  98%.
